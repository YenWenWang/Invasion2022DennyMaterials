1. Cut the lemongrass into small pieces, then place in a pot full of water 
and bring to boil until it becomes soft. Then remove from heat, drain off 
the excess water and set aside.
2. In another pan, pour oil and fry garlic. When it turns golden brown, 
add chili pepper (optional) and the lemongrass. Add the dried fish flakes 
and cook for 2 minutes. Then add soy sauce and sugar. Finally, put back 
the lemongrass into the pot and heat up again until it boils. The taste 
will be better if you use fresh lemon grass as much as possible.
3. Pour into serving bowls, garnish with coriander leaves and serve hot.
