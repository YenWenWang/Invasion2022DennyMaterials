5 spice seaweed, also called five color rice or rainbow rice. This is a 
dish of colored rice with flavored seaweed and nuts. It's very popular in 
China, where it is served at banquets and as an appetizer. The five colors 
are red (red bean), white (white sugar), yellow (yellow bean), black 
(sesame seeds) and green (green onions). It's also known as "five color" 
rice because the five different colors of beans look like the five colors 
on a standard color wheel. These colorful little packets can be frozen for 
later use.
1 cup dried seaweed (or about 3 1/2 ounces if fresh)
3 cups cooked white rice
5 cloves garlic
6 green onions
1 teaspoon salt
Â½ cup roasted peanuts, chopped into small pieces
4 tablespoons peanut oil
In a large bowl, add all ingredients except for the nuts and stir well. 
Transfer to a baking pan lined with parchment paper and spread out evenly. 
Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit until golden brown, approximately 10 
minutes. Remove from oven and let cool before serving. Serve with soy 
sauce.
