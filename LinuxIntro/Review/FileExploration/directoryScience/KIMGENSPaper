Kinship estimation is necessary for evaluating violations of assumptions 
or testing certain hypotheses in many population genomic studies. However, 
kinship estimators are usually designed for diploid systems and cannot be 
used in populations with mixed haploid diploid genetic systems. The data 
presented here reveal that the k-anatomy method (KA) is a valid and 
efficient tool to estimate lineage relationships in such a system. In 
particular, we show how the k-anatomy method can be easily extended to the 
case where there is only one type of lineage, as in the Drosophila 
melanogaster population. By applying this technique to an ancestral 
population sampled from multiple sites across Europe, it was possible to 
reconstruct migratory movements spanning over 4500 years: a remarkable 
accomplishment considering the very short time scales involved.
