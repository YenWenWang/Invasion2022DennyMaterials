Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that 
they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They lived in a nice 
little house in the country, which they kept clean and tidy at all times 
so as not to upset their neighbors, who had enough problems of their own 
without having to look after the Dursleys too. The Dursleys had no 
children of their own, but they took it upon themselves to mind Harry 
Potter every summer when he came to stay with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle 
Vernon...
Dursley's parents didn't bother to correct them; they'd said the same 
thing about the previous two Dursleys' kids too, until one of them had run 
away at age twelve. That child had grown up to be a member of the Order 
and had been killed fighting against Voldemort during the Battle of 
Hogwarts. Since then, Harry Potter had become an international 
celebrityâ€”and a wanted criminal. But on this particular afternoon, Mr. and 
Mrs. Dursley were more worried about a visit from a neighbor than they 
were about the Dementors patrolling outside their home in search of a new 
victim.
The Dursleys sat in their living room, pretending to watch television 
while their minds were elsewhere. Harry was upstairs changing for dinner. 
He'd already eaten, but he always waited until his mother finished serving 
him to change out of his school uniform. It made her uncomfortable, and 
she was sure it embarrassed Harry too.
