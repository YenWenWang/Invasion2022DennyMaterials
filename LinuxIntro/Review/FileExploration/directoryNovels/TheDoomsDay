The meeting was held in a small, windowless room. The only light came from 
the glow of monitors and screens on the walls.
There were four men present: Anselm Kiefer, Bishop of the Archdiocese of 
New York; Father Michael Corrigan, a priest of the dioceses of Brooklyn 
and Queens who was also an expert on the supernatural; Father Emmanuel 
Adetoyese, who was a professor at Holy Cross; and Professor Abigail Folger 
of Columbia University's Department of Religious Studies.
"Thank you for coming," said Kiefer, pulling out the chair next to him and 
gesturing toward it with his hand. "Please be seated." He sat down 
himself.
Corrigan took his seat as well, while Folger remained standing. When no 
one else moved, she sighed and sat down.
Father Adetoyese glanced around the table. There weren't many people 
hereâ€”only those with a direct interest in this case. But if they'd had any 
doubts about whether or not they should be involved, those doubts would 
have been dispelled by the presence of Father Adetoyese's name on the 
invitation.
