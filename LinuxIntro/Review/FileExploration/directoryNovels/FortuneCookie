The morning after the night before, I was enjoying a nice cup of coffee 
and watching the news when my phone rang. The caller ID showed it was from 
Kayli's cell number. Since she had never called me on that line before, I 
assumed something was wrong. When I answered, she sounded breathless.
"Is everything okay?" I asked. "You sound out of breath."
"No," she said quickly. "I'm fine now. Listen... there was an accident 
last night. An ambulance took one person to the hospital and two others 
were taken in by private vehicles. A couple of people got hurt pretty 
bad."
"What happened?" I asked, sitting up straight.
