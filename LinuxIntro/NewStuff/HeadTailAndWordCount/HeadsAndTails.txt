"I'll see you in a bit." I left the room with a heavy heart, and headed 
for my own quarters. They had been emptied out while I was gone; only the 
bed remained, as if to mock me. It made me think of the storybook beds 
that were always empty, waiting for their occupants' return. The thought 
nearly sent me running back to my quarters at the embassy, but I held 
myself together long enough to put on some fresh clothes and leave the 
palace. My guards opened the door, and I stepped through into a 
stone-lined courtyard.
The sun shone brightly overhead; a warm breeze played across my skin, 
ruffling my hair. A part of me wanted to stay here foreverâ€”not because it 
was pleasant or inviting, but because it reminded me of home, where spring 
came early and winter was brief. Here, the seasons seemed to last an 
eternity, dragging on day after endless day. One could almost feel the 
chill settling into his bones, even though there wasn't a breath of wind.
The palace grounds were mostly deserted, save for a few servants walking 
between buildings. I walked along slowly, letting the world pass by and 
thinking about what I'd learned from Borte so far. She didn't seem like 
much of a threat at first glance, but I couldn't help but wonder how she 
had managed to become Queen. It would be difficult to overthrow her 
without some sort of support from within the palace itself... which meant 
that my only option was to get inside.
I sighed heavily, and turned in the direction of the palace. It wouldn't 
do for me to arrive at the wrong place at the right time. As I neared the 
front entrance, I noticed something strange: the way the light reflected 
off the building's walls.
In my experience, most buildings looked rather dull when viewed from the 
outside, despite the fact that they were made of stone. But this one 
gleamed as if it had been coated in a fine layer of silver. I stopped and 
stared at it, trying to figure out what was different.
As I stood there, I spotted another glimmering object near the edge of the 
wall. I walked over and picked up a small white feather, holding it up to 
the sunlight. It sparkled as well, and I decided to keep them both.
My curiosity piqued, I continued toward the palace. As I drew closer, I 
saw a familiar face standing guard next to the main doors. He nodded 
briefly at me before returning his attention to the crowd gathered in 
front of him. There seemed to be quite a few people waiting, although not 
nearly as many as there had been during my previous visit. I wondered why 
they hadn't all come today. Perhaps they weren't permitted, being 
commoners.
I was just about to enter when I heard a voice behind me. "Borte?" I spun 
around, startled, and saw that it was a young woman who looked vaguely 
familiar. Her brown hair hung loosely down her shoulders, and she wore 
simple clothing that I knew too well: the kind of things we wore on our 
days off. She smiled at me, and I tried to remember where I might have 
seen her before.
"We've met," said the girl, stepping closer. She reached out and took my 
hand, pulling me along with her. "Don't you remember? You're the one who 
saved us from the soldiers, aren't you?"
I recognized the young woman now, and she was indeed the daughter of one 
of my friends. I remembered being told that her family had moved away 
before I returned to the palace, but I never expected to run into them 
again. And yet, here they were, looking happier than I'd ever seen them.
"You must be Borte," I said, smiling broadly. "What are you doing here?"
She pulled me into an embrace, and I hugged her back. "I'm supposed to 
meet my father, but he's late, so I thought I'd look for someone else to 
talk to. Do you know where he is?"
"He's usually in his office near the front gates," I answered. "Why don't 
you wait with me until he gets here? We can have lunch together."
Her face lit up, and she took my hand. "Yes! That sounds perfect. Thank 
you!"
