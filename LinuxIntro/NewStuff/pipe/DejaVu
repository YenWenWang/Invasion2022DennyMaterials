Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream
One spoon for two
And trading jackets
Laughing 'bout how small it looks on you
I love everything about her
But I still don't know what she wants from me
She's like a diamond in the rough
She shines brighter than most but won't let me pick her up
She always falls when I reach out to grab her hand
And I'm not sure if that's just the way she is or if there's something wrong with me too
