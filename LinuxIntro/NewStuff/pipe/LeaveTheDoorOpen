Said baby, said baby, said baby
What you doing? (What you doing?)
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Oh, you got plans? (You got plans?)
Don't say that (shut your trap)
'Cause I know what I'm gonna do now (what I'm gonna do now)
I ain't gon' get on that plane, no
Cuz if you don't plan to come with me
Then I'll tell them all about it when we're there
What you want from me? What you want from me?
(What you want from me?)
What you want from me?
All the things you did for me? What you done for me?
How you gave up your time for me?
