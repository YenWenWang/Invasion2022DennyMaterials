Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
If they don't drink too much, they'll be there tomorrow
For the friends who never say goodbye
Farewell to them as well
To those that we lost on our way
We'd like to thank them for making us stronger
To those that we left behind
We'd like to let them know
That they will always be in our hearts and minds
As long as we live, so let's raise a glass
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
