White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
You won't get away with this
No matter what you do to me
Yeah
***
I'm not afraid of the dark
I know it's here all the time
The world is gonna have to wait
Until I've found a way to get myself off
I'll be back in the morning
Like some kind of new born babe
Crawling out from under the bed
I've been out for hours and hours
Don't think that I could sleep at all
Just gotta find something real strong to drink
My head's spinning round and round
Can't see straight
