Yeah
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals and I'm not myself
Maybe I need a little help
I got a girl but she's not my type
And the way that we be actin' is just wrong
She don't know what she do to me
Sometimes I wish I was in your shoes
But then again it ain't right
So this time I'm gonna let you go
Oh yeah
Yeah
That's what friends are for
Yeah
You'll always have a friend in me
I know you're tired of all those bad boys
Just say the word
I got something good to tell you
