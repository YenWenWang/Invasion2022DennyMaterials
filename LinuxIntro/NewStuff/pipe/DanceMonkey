They say oh my God I see the way you shine
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
When the lights go down on this world of ours
And all of our troubles are left behind
I'll be holding tight to what I have found tonight
Oh it's been a long time coming but here we are together again,
Like old friends meeting after so many years apart.
